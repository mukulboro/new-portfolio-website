    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <center>
        <h2>Well, you are looking at my website, so why not take the time to get to know me better?</h2>
        <h2>Here are some quick facts about me:</h2>

        <button class="accordion">Wait, who are you?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Hi buddy, I am Mukul Aryal.<br>I write stupid code that works(most of the time).</p>
            <img src="https://yeklo.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/photos/2020/04/Cj4TJhtCBef564rlp2kP_avatar.jpg?cache=0" alt="mukul-aryal">
            <p>I was born and raised in Kathmandu, and I have immense love for the city.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What do you do?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>I don't do anything professionally(yet), but I like to write code and make whatever my heart desires.</p>
            <p>You may find some of my most recent projects in the <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> section of this website.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What other skills do you have?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>I can write content and make videos.</p>
            <p>During middle school, I ran a technology blog called MoMo Tech Nepal. While that is now completely dead, I make YouTube videos in my spare time nowadays.</p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIwyCyEBJHAL356l6Bjccrg"><img id="youtube" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/YouTube_full-color_icon_%282017%29.svg/1280px-YouTube_full-color_icon_%282017%29.svg.png" alt="youtube-channel"></a>
            <p>I have also written content for other blogs which you may find scattered around the inetrnet; but I'm too lazy to search and link those articles.</p>
            <p>You can still read some of what I've written in the <a href="/blog">blog</a> section of this website.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">How did you start programming?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>I've always had a keen interest in programming since the early days. Infact, I was one of the best QBASIC programmers in my schoolðŸ˜Ž</p>
            <p>But I was always too lazy to learn on my own.</p>
            <p>During the first quarter of 2021, I had to go through a surgery. My bed rest commbined with the fact that Nepal was in lockdown again made it so that I was stuck indoors for a LONG time.</p>
            <p>I decided to learn how to code with Python first and then I made JavaScript my language of choice.</p>
            <p>This website you're looking at is roughly what 3 months of learning has turned into.</p>
